# Ciphers
Is an algorithms for performing encryption or decryption â€” a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
Ciphers uses in secret correspondences, in transmit the secret documents, in security transactions in banks and the Internet.

In this repository I present my realization of various encryption algorithms

# Realized ciphers:
    RC4
    A3 ( in development stage )
